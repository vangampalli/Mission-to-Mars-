# web-scraping-challenge

For this project, an html was designed that scraped data from multiple websites to obtain the news and images of Mars. The latest Mars related news came from https://redplanetscience.com/, the featured mars image was obtained from https://spaceimages-mars.com/, the mars facts were obtained from https://galaxyfacts-mars.com/, and finally the mars hemisphere pictures was obtained from https://marshemispheres.com/. Jupyter notebook was used to write the initial code to scrape the websites using Splinter to open and interact with the websites and BeautifulSoup to parse through the html. The mars dataframe that was used was created with Pandas. The data obtained from the scrape was stored in a  on a Mongo Database that was then called upon through Flask to open a website on a local server that would contain that stored information. The files containing the code written to scrape are mission_to_mars.ipynb and scrape_mars.py(this was the file that contained the scraping code that was called). The file containing the Flask application is app.py. The template for the html that is opened through Flask is saved in the templates folder as index.html.
